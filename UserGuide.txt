To generate data for COOP computation from experimental/simulation images:
1. Download "Codes for COOP PreProcessing" folder
2. Run actinDetectMulti.m
- When prompted, navigate the folder that contains all the images that you want to analyze and select all the images that you'd like to analyze
- Enter the calibration factor (around 6.22 for each image, see Excel sheet "model image analysis info" for exact values)
- Enter the image threshold (start around 0.15)
- Resulting files for COOP analysis will be saved with the extension '_actinOrientation.mat'

-------------------

To generate COOP results from data files:
1. In "Codes for COOP PreProcessing" folder, run COOP_MultiFOV_Shapes_2014_03_02_Squares.m
- Enter the type of construct for analysis. For our purpsoses, we input "1" for Actin
- Enter the second type of construct for analysis. For our purpsoses, we input "1" for Actin
- Enter a length scale for analysis. The conversion is ~6 pixles per um. For our purpsoes, we chose S=6 (~1 um), S=18 (~3 um) or S=93 (~15 um)
- When prompted, select the folder that contains all the data files that you want to analyze (the files with the '_actinOrientation.mat' extension)
- When prompted, select the folder that contains all the data files that you want to analyze (the files with the '_actinOrientation.mat' extension)
- When prompted, select all the data files that you'd like run the COOP on (the files with the '_actinOrientation.mat' extension)
- COOP results files are saved with the extension 'ALLShapesCOOP.mat'. 
Note: The COOP results files were renamed and sorted according to the type of cell analyzed
The naming format used was "AspectRatio"_"CellType"_vs_"CellType"_"Scale"ALLShapesCOOP.mat
For example: AR1_Exp_vs_Exp_S=6AllShapesCOOP corresponds to square cell shape (AR1), experiment versus experiment comparison, 1um scale (S=6)
The results files were then sorted into folders according to the length scale and cell type comparisons used
Each folder of results was also sorted according to the figure that was created using the results.
For example: The "fig3-4 related results" folder contains folders of all results that are need to create figures 3 and 4 in the submitted paper

-------------------

To generate simulation results:
1. Download "simulation codes" folder.
2. For figure 2, run single_cell_units_linked_v3_NucPlacement.m. For figures 3 and 4, run single_cell_units_linked_v3_ARvaried.m 

-------------------

Codes used from Matlab File Exchange:
arclength.m
dijkstra.m
inpoly.m
intersections.m
LineCurvature2D.m
tspo_ga.m

-------------------

To create figures used in the submitted paper:
1. To visualize the model-generated networks, need to go to the PostProcessing folder and select the appropriate code.
First, be sure to load the parameter file and the model results file into Matlab and then execute the network visualization codes
- For figure 2: postprocess_Network_pic_NucPlacement.m
- For figure 4: postprocess_Network_pic_AR.m

2. To create the other plots in the figures, consult the specific folder for each figure
- Figure 2: 
fig2_v2_COOP_viz_code.m creates the colored COOP circles
fig2_v2_T_Nf_barPlots.m creates the bar plots of T and Nf

- Figure 3:
postprocess_Lc_AR.m creates curve length versus aspect ratio plot
postprocess_NumFibers_AR.m creates number of fibers versus aspect ratio plot
postprocess_T_AR.m creates traction stress magnitude versus aspect ratio

- Figure 4: 
COOP_colormaps_viz.m creates the colored COOP circles
COOP_vs_AR_vize_code.m creates the COOP versus aspect ratio plot with multiple length scales
COOP_vs_AR_singleS_viz_code.m creates the COOP versus aspect ratio plot for a single length scale
