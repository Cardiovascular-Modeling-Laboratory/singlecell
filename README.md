# singlecell
This collection of codes is the implementation of the theoretical model for creating a dynamic cytoskeletal network within a prescribed cell geometry

# Getting Started
1. Download all singlecell Matlab codes
2. Run parameters.m to load the parameter file
3. Run singlecell.m to implement the model. 
When prompted, identify the cell geometry, initial condition, whether the nucleus should be classified as an obstruction that requires an energetic cost to interact with, and (if needed) where the nucleus will be located
4. Results will be saved with the file marker "*_results_store.mat".
